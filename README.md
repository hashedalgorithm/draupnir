# Draupnir

Draupnir is a dynamic form generator for JavaScript applications, designed to streamline the process of creating forms based on JSON Schema. Unlike some existing libraries, Draupnir prioritizes flexibility and customization, empowering developers to tailor the form renderer to their specific needs.

## Features

- **Dynamic Form Generation**: Quickly generate forms from JSON Schema definitions.
- **Customizable Renderer**: Developers have full control over the form's appearance and behavior, enabling seamless integration with custom form components and validation logic.
- **Simple Integration**: Easily integrate Draupnir into your project with minimal setup.

## Installation

You can install Draupnir via npm:

```bash
npm install draupnir
```

## Usage

---

Using Draupnir is straightforward. Simply provide your JSON Schema to the form generator, along with any customizations for the form renderer.

Here's a basic example:

jsxCopy code

`import React from 'react';
import { DraupnirRoot, DraupnirProvider } from 'draupnir';

// Define your JSON Schema
const schema = {
// Your JSON Schema here
};

// Customize form renderer components
const widgets = {
base: {
string: StringWidget,
// Add more custom form components as needed
},
nonreactive: {},
custom: {},
};

// Render the form
const App = () => (
<DraupnirRoot className='' widgets={widgets}>
<DraupnirProvider schema={schema}></DraupnirProvider>
</DraupnirRoot>
);

export default App;`
